          The hottest comic in America, Sebastian Maniscalco, joins forces with legendary Italian-American 
          and two-time Oscar winner Robert De Niro, in the new comedy "About My Father." 
          The film centers around Sebastian (Maniscalco) who is encouraged by his fianc√©e (Leslie Bibb) to 
          bring his immigrant hairdresser father Salvo (De Niro) to a weekend get-together with her super-rich
        and exceedingly eccentric family (Kim Cattrall, Anders Holm, Brett Dier, David Rasche). 
        The weekend develops into what can only be described as a culture clash, leaving Sebastian and Salvo 
        to discover that the great thing about family is everything about family.
